# Project Description

In this project, I will develop a Sentiment Analysis ML model that predicts Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiment based on the text of Amazon reviews.

## Application

Because most reviews are paired with a star-rating, the application of this model is fairly limited (since the star-rating can be used as a direct measurement of sentiment.) It may, however, have applications in Tweet Sentiment analysis. For example, to discover the sentiment of Tweets about a particular company.

## Goal

My goal is to learn about Natural Language Processing, it has long been an interest area of mine.

## Data Source

Jianmo Ni, Jiacheng Li, and Julian McAuley. 2018. Amazon Review Data \[json\]. Retrieved from [https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html)
